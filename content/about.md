Presentation
==================

Hi visitor, you have reached my webpage which is part of me learning webdesign at Blekinge Technical University. 

In this course we use nodejs, npm, twig, SCSS, CSS, html to construct user-friendly, well-balanced and attractive webpages.

Responsivity is a recurring theme and we learn to adapt our pages for different devices.
