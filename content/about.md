### KMOM01
We dig set up a basic framework for a webpage by some type of magic called Pico, maybe it gets clearer if I use it more. We have also started using Markdown to write simplified HTML-code that can be compiled into regular HTML and ran as such. To be able to manage versions of our website we are using Github. A lot of things to grasp early on, and the site looks sad.

### KMOM02 
We have now started implementing SCSS and try out its functionality (you can code in it! just gotta figure out how). Some focus on smart construction of reusable variables for setting base theme on website, also talked some about style and typography to create appealing site layouts anc color schemes. Boxes in golde ratio seem to be the basic. Gotta learn how to handle them though.

### KMOM03
Coming up...
